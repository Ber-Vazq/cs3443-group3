The trail of this twisted&#10; Phantasmic art piece leads to a monster metal and flesh, like an excised Tumor of the building itself. The last thing&#10; to come back to you is memories. The sight of the monster's wounds brings back the last moments of the &#10;abomination, and the method of its execution." />

Only a few hacked welding drones remain, a far cry from the gear you brought with you.

Cerebral and Neural damage from a psionic assault. You engage in a battle of wills with a mind already broken, a stream of binary and horrified thoughts assault your mind, shards of its mind striking at yours. With a desperate cry that is more felt than heard, you strike with a wraith born from fear, rage, and desperation. You stare of the corpse of both victim and monster with terror at what this soul has become. You feel the echoes of its shattered mind for who knows how long, then, you feel more of them, then you run, and run and run." wrapText="true" />
