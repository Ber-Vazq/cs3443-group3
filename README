This is the Chimera game project

TO RUN:
	There should only be a need to clone the repository and go through the standard steps to run a javafx application.
	For the sake of clarity I will detail those steps below:
		1. Right click on the name of the project
		2. Go to Run As and click on Run Configurations
		3. Once at that menu maneuver to the Arguments tab
		4. In the VM arguments section copy and paste the following line
			--module-path C:path to your version of OpenJFX\javafx SDK version here\lib --add-modules javafx.controls,javafx.fxml
			For Mac it should be the same command in the VM Argument field simply without the C:
		5. Then UNSELECT the FIRST checkbox underneath the VM Arguments section(for clarity it is underneath this step)
			"Use the -XstartOnFirstThread argument when launching with SWT"
		6. From there just click apply and you should be able to run the program with no issues.

This is our attempt at a text-based pseudo roguelike game focused around dystopian elements(akin to Shadowrun, CyberPunk and the derivatives).

KNOWN BUGS:
	If using version 8 of java our menu gif will not be visible, as of now no other bugs reported
	If you die before finishing the game then restart your health will stay at the value from before

There is no login info, you just press play

Personally(Bernardo here) I used java15 and SceneBuilder 17.0 according to my download, the only known issue with any other version of Java is in the known bugs area
